        <p class="gutter unit unit-xs-1 unit-s-1 unit-m-1-2 unit-l-1-2 brand-family-body-copy">Wink is owned and operated by a father son team of friends and business partners. Five years ago Kerry Wilson and son Brendan both ran a screen printing shop in Canada's Capital. Together they kept noticing how much time was waisted on mixing, checking, cataloging and updating their colour books. Brendan got in touch with some computer programers and with them designed the software needed for a one of a kind ink management system. After it was done Kerry brought it to a few companies around town. Shortly after that Kerry and Brendan were forced to give up there printing contracts to their competators and focus on Wink full time.</p>
    
<p class="gutter unit unit unit-xs-1 unit-s-1 unit-m-1-2 unit-l-1-2 brand-family-body-copy">Now Wink has over 5000 business users and 200,000 private users. Wink is used in almost every country in the world and throughout the years has hosts trade shows all over the world to further promote and develop the service. Wink has won several industry awards and has been recognized by the N.S.A.C.(National Screen Printing Association of Canada) as Canada's leader in screen printing inovation. Wink doesn't want to stop with ink but plans to expand further into the other realms of the screen printing industry. Always taking feed back, Wink is constantly working towards the best ink management system it can be.</p>
